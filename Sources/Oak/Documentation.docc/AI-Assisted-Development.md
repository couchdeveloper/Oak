# AI-Assisted Development with Oak

Oak's structured finite state machine approach creates an ideal environment for AI-assisted coding, enabling a powerful collaboration between human creativity and AI systematic implementation.

## Overview

The finite state machine pattern provides clear, mechanical rules that AI can follow systematically while humans focus on creative problem-solving and domain expertise. This division of labor transforms FSM development from a purely manual process into an efficient, collaborative workflow - especially valuable during refactoring efforts or when scaling to larger state machines with many transitions.

## Where AI Excels with Oak

### State Space Expansion
Given requirements like "user authentication with session timeout," AI can suggest comprehensive state enums covering all scenarios including edge cases that humans might overlook.

```swift
// AI can systematically expand from basic requirements
enum AuthState {
    case unauthenticated
    case authenticating(credentials: Credentials)
    case authenticated(user: User, expiresAt: Date)
    case sessionExpired(lastUser: User)
    case authenticationFailed(error: AuthError, retryCount: Int)
    case locked(until: Date)
}
```

### Exhaustive Refactoring
When adding new states or events, AI systematically updates all affected transitions without missing cases, ensuring complete coverage.

### Pattern Completion
AI recognizes incomplete `switch` statements and suggests missing state/event combinations, preventing runtime crashes from unhandled cases.

### Consistency Checking
AI verifies that state transitions follow logical rules and identifies unreachable states or impossible combinations before they become bugs.

## The Perfect Division of Labor

### Humans Provide
- **Domain knowledge**: Understanding business rules and user requirements
- **Acceptance criteria**: Defining what constitutes correct behavior
- **High-level architecture**: Choosing appropriate abstractions and patterns
- **Creative problem-solving**: Designing elegant solutions to complex challenges

### AI Handles
- **Mechanical pattern matching**: Applying consistent patterns across the codebase
- **Exhaustive case analysis**: Ensuring all possible combinations are handled
- **Systematic refactoring**: Updating all affected code when requirements change
- **Type-safe code generation**: Producing compilable, correct implementations

## Why This Collaboration Works

This collaboration is particularly powerful because FSMs separate concerns cleanly:

- **Timing and performance** belong in Effects, not state transitions
- **Domain logic** is expressed as business rules, not implementation details
- **The compiler verifies correctness** regardless of who wrote the code

FSMs provide a mathematical foundation that AI can reason about systematically, while humans focus on the conceptual design and domain expertise.

## Real-World Impact

Rather than spending hours manually updating dozens of transition cases when requirements change, developers can:

1. **Focus on conceptual design** - What states and events make sense for this domain?
2. **Define business rules** - When should each transition occur?
3. **Let AI handle implementation** - Systematic updates across all affected code
4. **Verify behavior** - Test the resulting state machine against requirements

This approach dramatically reduces the cognitive load of FSM development and eliminates the tedious refactoring work that traditionally made state machines feel cumbersome.

## Best Practices for AI Collaboration

### Start with Clear Requirements
Provide AI with explicit domain knowledge and business rules rather than expecting it to infer complex logic.

### Verify Generated Code
Always test AI-generated state machines against your requirements, especially for edge cases and error conditions.

### Iterative Refinement
Use AI to explore different state modeling approaches, then refine based on domain expertise and user feedback.

### Maintain Human Oversight
While AI excels at systematic implementation, human judgment remains essential for architectural decisions and domain modeling.

## Getting Started

The most effective AI-assisted Oak development begins with:

1. **Clear state identification** - What are the distinct modes your system can be in?
2. **Event enumeration** - What can happen to change those modes?
3. **Transition rules** - When should each change occur?
4. **AI implementation** - Let AI generate the systematic switch statements and pattern matching

This approach leverages AI's strengths while maintaining human control over the essential design decisions.
