/// **Transducer - Pure Finite State Machine Protocol**
///
/// Defines deterministic event-driven state machines with mathematical rigor.
/// Eliminates edge cases through explicit (state, event) → outcome mappings.
///
/// Transducers embody finite state machine theory: every state/event combination 
/// has a defined transition, making undefined behavior impossible. This mathematical
/// foundation transforms complex concurrent scenarios into predictable, testable logic.
///
/// ## Core Components
/// - **State**: Finite set of possible machine states with terminal detection
/// - **Event**: Input alphabet that drives state transitions  
/// - **Output**: Optional values produced during transitions
/// - **update()**: Pure function encoding transition and output logic
///
/// ## Quick Example
/// ```swift
/// enum Counter: Transducer {
///     enum State { case idle(Int) }
///     enum Event { case increment, decrement }
///     
///     static func update(_ state: inout State, event: Event) -> Int {
///         switch (state, event) {
///         case (.idle(let count), .increment):
///             state = .idle(count + 1)
///             return count + 1
///         case (.idle(let count), .decrement):
///             state = .idle(max(0, count - 1))
///             return max(0, count - 1)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// > architectural patterns, and advanced usage scenarios.
