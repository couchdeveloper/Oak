    ///
    /// Given a transducer, `MyUseCase`, that conforms to `Transducer`, a transducer view can be
    /// created by using one of the initialiser overloads. This initialiser uses a `SwiftUI.Binding` as
    /// the source of the state and the initial state value for the transducer.
    ///
    ///```swift
    /// struct ContentView: View {
    ///     @State private var state: MyUseCase.State = .init()
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         TransducerView(
    ///             of: MyUseCase.self,
    ///             initialState: $state
    ///         ) {
    ///             content: { state, input in
    ///                 GreetingView(
    ///                     greeting: state.greeting,
    ///                     send: { try input.send($0) }
    ///                 )
    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// The below `GreetingView` view shows how to compose a content view. This view is
    /// also completely decoupled from transducer symbols.
    /// ```swift
    /// struct GreetingView: View {
    ///     let greeting: String
    ///     let send: (Event) throws -> Void
    ///
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         VStack {
    ///             Text(greeting)
    ///         }

    ///             send(.submit)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// Each content view should have a _state_ constant and a `send` function. The state will
    /// change whenever the transducer produces a new state. The send function is used by the
    /// view to send user's intents (aka events) to the transducer.
    ///
    /// Basically, a content view should be _a function of state_, i.e. it itself performs no logic. This
    /// makes sense, since there's the transducer which solely exists to perform this computation.
    /// A view may only manages its own private state when it is invariant of the given logic defined
    /// by the transducer.
