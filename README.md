A type-safe, asynchronous finite state machine implementation for Swift, with powerful effect handling and SwiftUI integration.

## Development Status

Oak is actively developed and evolving. The library is well-tested and functional, with a stable core API. While we maintain backward compatibility where possible, the API may evolve as we incorporate community feedback and add new features.

**Contributions welcome!** We encourage developers to try Oak, provide feedback, and contribute to its evolution. Follow the repository for updates and join discussions in Issues.

## Overview

Oak provides a robust implementation of finite state machines (FSM), also known as finite state transducers (FST) for Swift applications. It enables you to model complex state transitions and side effects in a type-safe, testable, and maintainable way.


```swift
// Simple, non-terminating counter state machine with async effects
enum CounterTransducer: EffectTransducer {    
    struct State: NonTerminal {
        var value: Int = 0
        var pending: Pending = .none
        var isPending: Bool { pending != .none }
    }
    
    static var initialState: State { State() }
    
    typealias TransducerOutput = Self.Effect?

    struct Env {}
    
    enum Event {
        case increment
        case decrement
        case reset
        case incrementReady
        case decrementReady
    }
    
    enum Pending {
        case none
        case increment
        case decrement
    }
    
    // Effect for increment: creates an operation effect
    static func incrementEffect() -> Self.Effect {
        Effect(
            operation: { env, input in
                try input.send(.incrementReady)
            }
        )
    }
    
    // Effect for decrement: creates an operation effect
    static func decrementEffect() -> Self.Effect {
        Effect(
            operation: { env, input in
                try input.send(.decrementReady)
            }
        )
    }
    
    static func update(_ state: inout State, event: Event) -> TransducerOutput {
        switch (state.pending, event) {
        case (.none, .increment):
            state.pending = .increment
            return incrementEffect()
        case (.none, .decrement):
            state.pending = .decrement
            return decrementEffect()
        case (.none, .reset):
            state = State(value: 0, pending: .none)
            return nil
        case (.increment, .incrementReady):
            state.value += 1
            state.pending = .none
            return nil
        case (.decrement, .decrementReady):
            state.value -= 1
            state.pending = .none
            return nil
            // Ignore increment/decrement events during pending operation
        case (_, .increment), (_, .decrement):
            return nil
        case (_, .reset):
            state = State(value: 0, pending: .none)
            return nil
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }
}
```

## Features

- **Type-safety**: Leverage Swift's type system to catch invalid usage at compile time
- **Actor isolation**: Safe execution across different isolation contexts with automatic inference
- **Side effect management**: Structured handling of asynchronous side effects with proper cancellation
- **Environment support**: Provide typed environment to effects for dependencies and configuration
- **Async/await support**: Built on Swift's structured concurrency model
- **SwiftUI integration**: Reactive bindings with `TransducerView`
- **Composability**: Pipe transducer outputs into other transducer inputs
- **Effect composition**: Combine multiple effects sequentially or in parallel
- **Back pressure support**: In compositions, a connected output awaits readiness of the consumer
- **Completion callbacks**: Handle transducer completion with type-safe callbacks
- **Optional proxy parameters**: Simplified API with automatic proxy creation

### TransducerView

#### Optional Proxy Parameters
`TransducerView` supports optional proxy parameters. When no proxy is provided, it automatically creates a default proxy:

```swift
// Simplified - no explicit proxy needed
TransducerView(of: MyTransducer.self, initialState: .initial) { state, input in
    // UI content
}

// Still supported - explicit proxy
TransducerView(of: MyTransducer.self, initialState: .initial, proxy: MyProxy()) { state, input in
    // UI content
}
```

#### Completion Callbacks
Handle transducer completion with type-safe callbacks that are called when the transducer finishes:

```swift
TransducerView(
    of: MyTransducer.self,
    initialState: .initial,
    completion: { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let output):
            print("Transducer completed successfully with output: \(output)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Transducer failed with error: \(error)")
        }
    }
) { state, input in
    // UI content
}
```

> **Note**: Completion callbacks are always invoked when the transducer finishes, whether it completes successfully or encounters an error. The callback receives a `Result` that contains either the success value or the error.

#### Architecture

`TransducerView` can replace conventional ViewModel implementations using `ObservableObject` or the Observation framework. It directly uses the view's `@State` as the transducer's state and utilizes SwiftUI's built-in diffing facility for efficient updates.

This supports a **"View only architecture"** where traditional artifacts like Model, ViewModel, Router, and Interactor are consolidated and implemented directly as SwiftUI views.


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

In Xcode, select **File â†’ Add Packagesâ€¦** and enter:
```
https://github.com/couchdeveloper/Oak.git
```

Or add to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/couchdeveloper/Oak.git", from: "0.15.0")
]
```

## Quick Start

Oak uses **transducers** - finite state machines that process events and produce outputs. Here's how to create one:

### 1. Define Your Transducer

```swift
import Oak

enum SimpleCounter: EffectTransducer {
    struct State: NonTerminal {
        var count: Int = 0
    }
    
    static var initialState: State { State() }
    typealias TransducerOutput = Self.Effect?
    struct Env {}
    
    enum Event {
        case increment
        case decrement
    }
    
    static func update(_ state: inout State, event: Event) -> TransducerOutput {
        switch event {
        case .increment:
            state.count += 1
        case .decrement:
            state.count -= 1
        }
        return nil
    }
}
```

### 2. Run Your Transducer

```swift
let proxy = SimpleCounter.Proxy()

let task = Task {
    try await SimpleCounter.run(
        initialState: SimpleCounter.initialState,
        proxy: proxy,
        env: SimpleCounter.Env()
    )
}

// Send events
try proxy.send(.increment)
try proxy.send(.decrement)
```

### 3. Use in SwiftUI

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TransducerView(
            of: SimpleCounter.self,
            initialState: SimpleCounter.initialState,
            env: SimpleCounter.Env()
        ) { state, input in
            VStack {
                Text("Count: \(state.count)")
                Button("Increment") { try? input.send(.increment) }
                Button("Decrement") { try? input.send(.decrement) }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: The `proxy` parameter is optional. If omitted, `TransducerView` creates a default proxy automatically.

## Core Concepts

### Transducer
A finite state machine that processes events and produces outputs with optional side effects.

Transducers are implemented as async throwing functions rather than classes with mutable state. This design enables better composability since functions can be composed more easily than objects, and eliminates the need for object lifecycle management.

### Proxy
A proxy provides an asynchronous event channel for sending events to the transducer and letting the transducer obtain these events in an async loop. A proxy is required to start a transducer:

```swift
let proxy = CounterTransducer.Proxy()
try await CounterTransducer.run(
    initialState: CounterTransducer.initialState,
    proxy: proxy
)
```

It can also be used to send events and to forcibly cancel the transducer:

```swift
try proxy.send(.increment)
proxy.cancel()
```

### State
The state of the finite state machine must conform to `Terminable`.

A transducer can run with strictly encapsulated state or with shared state defined in an actor. For strictly encapsulated state, the initial state value is passed to the `run` function. If the state is shared, a binding is used, allowing external components to observe state changes.

```swift
struct State: Terminable {
    var value: Int = 0
    var isTerminal: Bool { value > 10 }
}
```

For non-terminal states, conform to `NonTerminal`:
```swift
struct State: NonTerminal {
    var value: Int = 0
}
```


### Event
Input values that trigger state transitions in the finite state machine.

Events represent things that happen in your system - user actions, network responses, timer events, etc. They are processed by the transducer's `update` function to produce state changes and effects.

```swift
enum Event {
    case userTapped
    case dataReceived(Data)
    case timeout
}
```

### Input

Represents the input channel of a transducer. A proxy has an `input` property which provides access to the transducer's input channel.

An input is used to send events into the transducer. It's passed as a parameter to effect operations and can be shared with other components. Components that only have access to the input interface cannot forcibly cancel the transducer.

```swift
Effect(isolatedOperation: { _, input, _ in
    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000)
    try input.send(.ready)
})
```

### Output
Values produced by the transducer's update function that can be observed externally, enabling communication with other components or UI updates.

```swift
typealias Output = Int
static func update(_ state: inout State, event: Event) -> Output {
    state.counter += 1
    return state.counter // Output value
}
```

### Effect
An effect is a special output of an effect transducer. It encapsulates an asynchronous operation that can perform side effects and send events back to the transducer.

```swift
typealias Env {}
static func update(_ state: inout State, event: Event) -> Self.Effect? {
   // return an effect or nil
}
```

Effects come in two forms:
- **Actions**: Synchronous functions that return events immediately 
- **Operations**: Long-running, cancellable tasks that send events asynchronously

**Action Effect:**

```swift
static func createDelegate(param: Param) -> Effect {
    let delegate = MyDelegate(param: param)
    return .event(.delegate(delegate))
}
```

**Operation Effect:**

```swift
static func incrementEffect() -> Effect {
    Effect(isolatedOperation: { _, input, _ in
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000)
        try input.send(.incrementReady)
    })
}
```

For global actor isolation:

```swift
static func incrementEffect() -> Effect {
    Effect(operation: { @MyGlobalActor _, input in
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000)
        try input.send(.incrementReady)
    })
}
```

### Subject
A component that receives output values from a transducer, enabling communication with other parts of your application.

```swift
let output = Callback<Int> { value in
    print("Received output: \(value)")
}

try await CounterTransducer.run(
    initialState: state,
    proxy: proxy,
    output: output
)
```

## Basic Usage

```swift
// Create a proxy and run the transducer
let proxy = CounterTransducer.Proxy()

let task = Task {
    try await CounterTransducer.run(
        initialState: CounterTransducer.State(),
        proxy: proxy,
        env: CounterTransducer.Env()
    )
}

// Send events to the transducer
try proxy.send(.increment)
try proxy.send(.reset)
```

## SwiftUI Integration

```swift
import SwiftUI

extension EnvironmentValues {
    @Entry var myCounterEnv: CounterTransducer.Env = .init()
}

extension CounterExample.Views {
    
    typealias Counter = CounterTransducer

    struct CounterView: View {
        @Environment(\.myCounterEnv) var env
        
        var body: some View {
            TransducerView(
                of: Counter.self,
                initialState: Counter.initialState,
                env: env
            ) { state, input in
                ZStack {
                    VStack {
                        Text(verbatim: "Counter Value: \(state.value)")
                        Button("Increment") { try? input.send(.increment) }
                            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
                        Button("Decrement") { try? input.send(.decrement) }
                            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
                        Button("Reset") { try? input.send(.reset) }
                            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
                    }
                    .disabled(state.isPending)
                    if state.isPending {
                        ProgressView()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
}
```
