# Oak

Oak brings the power of finite state machines (FSM) to your projects. 


## Overview

FSMs are utilized to develop systems characterized by discrete and sequential behavior, effectively addressing a wide range of problems. The correctness of these systems is guaranteed by their mathematical framework, while their strength lies in their ability to be composed together.

The Oak library is primarily intended to help implementing the typical frontend patterns and architectures, ViewModels, Interactors, MVI, etc., but it is not limited to this use case.
