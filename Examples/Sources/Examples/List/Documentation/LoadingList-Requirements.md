**Epic:** Data Loading and State Management  

## Executive Summary

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a data loading interface component that demonstrates comprehensive state management patterns for async operations, user input collection, error handling, and data presentation within mobile applications.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Users require a reliable and intuitive interface for loading dynamic data with proper feedback mechanisms during async operations. The system must handle various failure scenarios gracefully while providing clear user guidance and recovery options.

### Success Criteria
- Users can successfully initiate data loading operations with custom parameters
- Users receive immediate and clear feedback during loading operations
- Users can recover from error conditions without application restart
- System maintains consistent state throughout all operation phases

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Application Initialization
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Description:** The application shall initialize in an empty state with clear user guidance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN the application launches
- WHEN the user views the initial screen
- THEN the system shall display an empty state view
- AND the view shall contain a descriptive message explaining the absence of data
- AND the view shall provide a primary action button labeled "Start"
- AND the message shall read "No data available. Press Start to load items."

### FR-002: Parameter Input Collection
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Description:** The system shall collect user input parameters for data loading operations through a modal interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN the user taps the "Start" button
- WHEN the action is triggered
- THEN the system shall present a modal sheet
- AND the sheet shall contain a text input field
- AND the sheet shall have a descriptive title "Load Data"
- AND the sheet shall include explanatory text "Enter a parameter to load data:"
- AND the sheet shall provide "Cancel" and "Load" action buttons
- AND the "Load" button shall be disabled when input is empty
- AND the input field shall be pre-populated with a default value "sample"

### FR-003: Loading State Management
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Description:** The system shall provide visual feedback during async data loading operations with cancellation capability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN the user confirms parameter input
- WHEN the loading operation begins
- THEN the modal sheet shall dismiss
- AND the system shall display a loading overlay
- AND the overlay shall contain a progress indicator
- AND the overlay shall display the message "Loading..."
- AND the overlay shall include descriptive text "Fetching data from service"
- AND the overlay shall provide a "Cancel" button
- AND the cancel button shall terminate the loading operation when pressed

### FR-004: Successful Data Presentation
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Description:** The system shall display loaded data in a structured list format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN the data loading operation completes successfully
- WHEN data is received from the service
- THEN the loading overlay shall dismiss
- AND the system shall display the data in a scrollable list
- AND each list item shall show an icon and text content
- AND the list shall support standard iOS list interactions

### FR-005: Error Handling and Recovery
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Description:** The system shall handle service failures gracefully and provide user recovery options.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN the data loading operation fails
- WHEN a service error occurs
- THEN the loading overlay shall dismiss
- AND the system shall display an error alert
- AND the alert shall have the title "Error"
- AND the alert shall show the error description
- AND the alert shall provide an "OK" button
- AND when "OK" is pressed, the system shall return to an empty state
- AND the empty state shall display "Loading failed" as the title
- AND the empty state shall show the error description
- AND the empty state shall provide a "Try again" button for retry

### FR-006: Operation Cancellation
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Description:** Users shall be able to cancel loading operations and input collection at any time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN a loading operation is in progress
- WHEN the user taps the "Cancel" button
- THEN the loading operation shall terminate immediately
- AND the system shall return to the previous content state
- AND no error message shall be displayed for user-initiated cancellation

**Secondary Scenario:**
- GIVEN the parameter input sheet is displayed
- WHEN the user taps "Cancel" or dismisses the sheet
- THEN the sheet shall close
- AND the system shall return to the empty state
- AND no loading operation shall be initiated

### FR-007: State Persistence During Modals
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Description:** The system shall maintain content state consistency during modal presentations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN the system has loaded data successfully
- WHEN a modal (input sheet, loading overlay, or error alert) is presented
- THEN the underlying content shall remain unchanged
- AND when the modal dismisses, the previous content state shall be restored
- AND data shall not be lost during modal interactions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
**Priority:** Must Have
- Loading operations shall provide immediate visual feedback (< 100ms)
- UI state transitions shall be smooth and without perceived delay
- Modal presentations shall animate smoothly using standard iOS animations

### NFR-002: Reliability
**Priority:** Must Have
- The system shall handle network timeouts gracefully
- The system shall prevent multiple simultaneous loading operations
- The system shall maintain state consistency during all error scenarios
- The system shall not crash due to service failures or invalid responses

### NFR-003: Usability
**Priority:** Must Have
- Error messages shall be user-friendly and actionable
- Loading states shall clearly indicate system activity
- All interactive elements shall meet iOS accessibility guidelines
- The interface shall follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines

### NFR-004: Maintainability
**Priority:** Should Have
- State management logic shall be testable in isolation
- UI components shall be reusable across different contexts
- Error handling patterns shall be consistent throughout the application
- Code shall support easy extension for additional loading scenarios

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Launch application → View empty state
2. Tap "Start" → View input sheet
3. Enter parameter → Tap "Load"
4. View loading overlay → Wait for completion
5. View data list → Verify content display

### Error Path
1. Launch application → View empty state
2. Tap "Start" → View input sheet
3. Enter parameter → Tap "Load"
4. Service fails → View error alert
5. Tap "OK" → View error recovery state
6. Tap "Try again" → Return to step 2

### Cancellation Path
1. Launch application → Initiate loading
2. During loading → Tap "Cancel"
3. Verify return to previous state
4. Verify no error displayed
